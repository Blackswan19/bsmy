        <h2>MFI Graph</h2>
        <p>The MFI graph represents interest values at three different dates: March 16, May 16, and July 16. Each bar corresponds to the interest value on that specific date. The values are plotted along the y-axis, with the interest values increasing from the bottom to the top.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>16 March:</strong> The interest value was 6. This value is shown in a light blue bar.</li>
            <li><strong>16 May:</strong> The interest value decreased slightly to 5, represented by another light blue bar.</li>
            <li><strong>16 July:</strong> The interest value increased significantly to 7. This value is shown in a darker blue bar to highlight the increase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A notable feature of this graph is the <span class="highlight">red-colored numeral 7</span> on the y-axis. This red color indicates that at no point did the interest values in the graph decrease by 7 units. Instead, 7 represents a significant threshold that the interest value reached in July.</p>
        <p>This graph helps you understand the trend in interest values over these three months, showing a general increase despite a small dip in May. The significance of the red numeral adds an extra layer of interpretation, emphasizing that the interest value of 7 is a key point in the data set.</p>
        <p><strong>How You Can Take Action:</strong></p>
        <p>Based on the interest values presented in the graph, you can decide when to take money for interest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In <strong>March</strong>, with an interest value of 6, it may be a good time to consider taking money if the interest is favorable compared to previous months.</li>
            <li>In <strong>May</strong>, the interest value decreases to 5, indicating a slight drop. You might decide to wait for a better rate unless you need immediate funds.</li>
            <li>In <strong>July</strong>, the interest value rises to 7, the highest value shown. This increase suggests an advantageous time to take money for interest, maximizing potential benefits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By monitoring these interest changes every two months, you can make informed decisions about when to take money based on the most favorable interest rates depicted in the graph.</p>
