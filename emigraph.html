        <h2>MFI Graph</h2>
        <p>The MFI graph represents index values at three different dates: March 16, May 16, and July 16. Each bar corresponds to the index value on that specific date. The values are plotted along the y-axis, with the index values increasing from the bottom to the top.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>16 March:</strong> The index value was 7. This value is shown in a light blue bar.</li>
            <li><strong>16 May:</strong> The index value increased significantly to 5, represented by a taller light blue bar.</li>
            <li><strong>16 July:</strong> The index value remained stable at 4, represented by another light blue bar of the same height.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A notable feature of this graph is the <span class="highlight">red-colored numeral 7</span> on the y-axis. This red color indicates that the index value of 7 in March was a significant low point. The index value increased in May and remained steady in July.</p>
        <p>This graph helps you understand the trend in index values over these three months, showing a general increase from March to May, with stability in July. The significance of the red numeral emphasizes that the index value of 7 is a key point in the data set.</p>
        <p><strong>How You Can Take Action:</strong></p>
        <p>Based on the index values presented in the graph, you can decide when to take money for interest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In <strong>March</strong>, with an index value of 7, it may be a good time to consider taking money if the index is lower compared to previous months.</li>
            <li>In <strong>May</strong>, the index value increases to 5, indicating an upward trend. You might decide to take advantage of this higher rate if you anticipate further increases.</li>
            <li>In <strong>July</strong>, the index value remains at 5, suggesting stability. This could be a safe time to take money for interest without expecting sudden changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By monitoring these index changes every two months, you can make informed decisions about when to take money based on the most favorable index rates depicted in the graph.</p>
